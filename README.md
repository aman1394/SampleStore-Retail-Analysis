Delving into the IT Spend Analysis project, I leveraged Power View for visualization due to certain unsupported visuals in Power BI. Upon identifying an incompatible visual type, I swiftly removed it, ensuring the integrity of the analysis. The modified file, named "IT Spend Analysis Sample.pbix," exemplifies my adeptness in adapting tools to suit analytical needs. Explore my journey through data visualization challenges in this dynamic project.

In the IT Spend Analysis project, I utilized Power View to create effective visualizations, adjusting my approach to overcome any limitations encountered with unsupported visuals in Power BI. By identifying and removing incompatible visual types, I ensured the continuity and accuracy of the analysis. The revised file, named "IT Spend Analysis Sample.pbix," highlights my proficiency in adapting visualization tools to meet analytical requirements. This project showcases my capability to navigate and resolve data visualization challenges dynamically.
